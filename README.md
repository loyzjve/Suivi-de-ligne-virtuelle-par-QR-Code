# Follow-a-virtual-line-by-QR-Code

## Subject
This subject consists in realizing a trajectory visualization by certain QR codes via a mobile robot from the company Agile.x using an rgbd-camera. It requires implementing a visualization under ROS of the distances and poses between the robot and this trajectory at any time.

## Hypothesis
At initialization and at any subsequent QR code position, it is assumed that the camera can observe at least 2 QR codes (for example, a landmark X and an after landmark X+1).

## Context


## Schedule(Gantt chart)




## The process
1. At initialization, we place a certain number of QR codes under our hypothesis.
2. Then, we manually control a mobile robot to scan all QR codes.
3. In addition, we calculate and look for a better trajectory that allows you to pass all the landmarks.
4. Finally, we display this result under Rviz.
